# Project handoff: Auto DM + Mehta Mart store

This file holds the full context of the project, so a new chat (or a new person) can pick up from here. Paste the "Start here" section at the bottom into a new chat.

## 1. Summary

When someone comments a keyword (e.g. `LINK`) on an Instagram reel, they get an automatic DM with a **Shop now** button. The button opens a store page with only that reel's products (1–20). Each reel has its own link.

That grew into a full online store, shown as a demo for **Mehta Mart** (mehtamartmhm.com):
- a home page, shop, categories, product pages and an Instagram-style Reels tab;
- shopper accounts, a checkout and a demo UPI payment page;
- an admin panel for the owner, on the same site and shown based on login.

It's live on the Oracle VM.

## 2. Key facts

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | `Shashank-Codes-bit/Auto_DM` (public) |
| Branch | `claude/affectionate-rubin-it8bkq`. All work is here, with no PR. |
| Live store | https://mehtamart.140-238-251-141.sslip.io |
| Admin | https://mehtamart.140-238-251-141.sslip.io/admin (log in on `/login` with `ADMIN_PHONE` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) |
| Health check | `/health` returns `ok` |
| Instagram business account | `@_shoppingforher_`, IG_USER_ID `17841465186333519` |
| Test commenter | `_squenza` (an Instagram tester on the Meta app). Comments from the business account itself are skipped. |
| Meta webhook | Callback `https://mehtamart.140-238-251-141.sslip.io/webhook`, verify token `shoppingforher-verify-2026`, field `comments` |
| Server | Oracle VM `svc-agent`, 140.238.251.141, Arm64, 1 OCPU, 6 GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04, shared with other sites |
| App on the VM | `~/mehtamart`, Docker Compose project `mehtamart`, service `web`, `127.0.0.1:8100`, volume `mehtamart_data` mounted at `/data`, secrets in `~/mehtamart/deploy/.env` |
| Front door | Caddy, site file `/etc/caddy/sites/mehtamart.caddy` (added with `add-site.sh`) |
| Old dev setup | GitHub Codespace on port 3000. It's no longer needed now that Meta points to the VM. |

## 3. How it works

1. **Comment arrives.** Meta sends a `comments` webhook to `POST /webhook`. The signature (`X-Hub-Signature-256`) is checked with `APP_SECRET`.
2. **Matching** (`src/handler.js`):
   - It skips comments from our own account, reels with no store, and paused reels.
   - Keywords are whole words and case doesn't matter.
   - Each comment is claimed once in the `activity` table, so duplicate deliveries send one DM.
   - The per-person limit is off (`ONE_DM_PER_USER=0`).
3. **The DM:**
   - It's sent as an Instagram **Private Reply** (`/{IG_USER_ID}/messages` with `recipient.comment_id`). Instagram allows one per comment, within 7 days.
   - It's sent as a button template. If Instagram rejects that, it falls back to plain text with the link.
   - An optional public reply goes under the comment.
   - The link is `PUBLIC_BASE_URL/r/<slug>?src=dm`.
4. **Reel store** `/r/<slug>`: the reel's products in the order they appear in the video. Each visit is counted (`visits` table).
5. **Instagram's in-app browser:**
   - The store works inside it.
   - An "Open full store in Chrome/Safari" block at the end of the page is always shown. A floating card appears once per session when the shopper reaches the end of the page.
   - The bag travels to the real browser in the link (`/shop?bag=…`).
6. **Checkout needs a login.**
   - Guests who tap Checkout go to `/login?next=/checkout` (with a "Create an account" link) and come back with the bag kept. The bag is stored in the browser.
   - Prices, delivery and stock are recalculated on the server.
   - Stock is reserved when the order is placed and restored on cancel.
7. **Payment is a demo.** `/order/<token>` shows a "Pay with UPI app" button (`upi://pay?...`), a UPI QR and an "I've paid" button. The owner confirms the payment in the admin panel. No real gateway is connected yet.

## 4. Features

**Storefront** (Light & gold design; fonts Bricolage Grotesque and Figtree):
- **Home `/`:** hero with today's top deal, category circles, price chips (Under ₹99/199/299/599/999, ₹1,000+), "From our reels" with Shop now, "Today's best deals" (featured products, otherwise the biggest discounts), trust points, a bulk-order WhatsApp banner, and a footer with GSTIN.
- **Shop `/shop` and categories `/c/<slug>`:** search, category chips, a "Filter & sort" bottom sheet (price band; sort by popular, discount or price), and "Show more" 24 at a time. Filters stay in the URL.
- **Product page `/p/<slug>`:** gallery with dots, MRP and % off, options (e.g. size), quantity, description, "You may also like", and a sticky Add to bag bar.
- **Reels tab `/reels`:** full-screen reels that snap one at a time. The reel on screen autoplays muted and a tap toggles sound. Each has a product strip and Shop now. `GET /api/reels?cursor=` loads 8 more at a time, and the feed ends with "You're all caught up". `/reels#<slug>` jumps to a reel. On desktop the arrow keys move between reels.
- **Other pages:** `/about`, plus a mobile tab bar (Home, Shop, Reels, Bag).

**Accounts and roles:**
- **Login:** phone + password (scrypt hashes) on `/login` and `/signup`. Sessions are a signed HttpOnly cookie (`sid`) lasting 30 days. Logged-in forms carry a CSRF token, and logins are rate-limited.
- **My account `/account`:** orders, the saved address (filled in at the next checkout) and a password change.
- **Every signup is a customer.** Admin rights come only from the server command `npm run role` (section 8).
- **The `.env` owner** (`ADMIN_PHONE` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) is created or made admin on every start. Their password always comes from `.env`.
- **Customers who open `/admin`** are sent to `/account`.

**Owner tools:**
- **Owner bar** on every store page, with "Edit this page". Edit buttons appear on product cards, the category header and reels.
- **Dashboard setup checklist** that ticks itself off: connect Instagram, store details, products, first reel store, first comment, first order. It can be hidden.
- **Admin sections:**
  - **Dashboard:** numbers per reel (DMs, then visits, then orders).
  - **Orders:** status flow, plus a WhatsApp link to the customer.
  - **Products:** photos by upload or link, categories, Featured switch, archive.
  - **Categories:** add, hide and reorder, with an image.
  - **Reels:** pick 1–20 products per reel, keywords, DM text, button text, public reply, live or paused.
  - **Customers:** order counts and spend, and a password reset that shows a new password for the owner to send on WhatsApp.
  - **DM activity.**
  - **Settings:** store info, home and About text, trust points, GSTIN, delivery fee, free-delivery threshold, UPI ID, contacts, the Instagram connection, and **Load demo data**.

**Demo data** (`seed/mehtamart.json` v2, loaded from Admin → Settings → Load demo data):
- 13 Mehta Mart collections as categories, with images.
- 178 products with real names, prices, MRPs, descriptions and photo links (from cdn.dotpe.in). The 8 biggest discounts are featured.
- Store text: tagline "Think Shopping. Think Us!", about text, WhatsApp 919320001717, email, GSTIN 27ATJPM7943G1Z9.
- The 3 newest reels map to Kitchen Creations (`KITCHEN`, `LINK`), Fresh Start Cleaning (`CLEAN`, `LINK`) and Trending Toys (`TOYS`, `LINK`).
- It's safe to load again: categories and products match by name, and settings the owner has changed are kept.

## 5. Code map

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/server.js` | Builds the Express 5 app: security headers, `/health`, webhook, mounts the routes. On start it opens the DB and runs `ensureOwner`. `trust proxy` is 1. |
| `src/config.js` | Reads `.env` |
| `src/auth.js` | Session cookie, CSRF, rate limit, `requireUser` / `requireAdmin`, `safeNext` |
| `src/db/index.js`, `src/db/schema.sql` | Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`) or embedded **PGlite** in `DATA_DIR`. The schema is applied on every start and is safe to re-run. Money is stored in paise. |
| `src/repos/*.js` | Data access: products, categories, reels (incl. `feed`), orders, users, settings, activity, stats, media |
| `src/handler.js` | Comment → DM logic |
| `src/instagram.js` | Graph API calls (graph.instagram.com). `DRY_RUN=1` only logs. |
| `src/routes/store.js` | Storefront pages, `/api/products`, `/api/reels`, `/api/orders`, `/media/:id` |
| `src/routes/account.js` | `/login`, `/signup`, `/logout`, `/account` |
| `src/routes/admin.js` | Admin panel, checklist, categories, customers, demo data |
| `src/views/store.js`, `src/views/admin.js` | Server-rendered HTML (safe `html` tagged template in `src/views/html.js`) |
| `src/views/assets.js` | Fingerprints `/static` URLs (`?v=hash`) so browsers load new CSS and JS after each deploy |
| `public/` | `store.css`, `cart.js` (bag, sheets, checkout, Chrome prompt), `reels.js` (feed), `admin.css`, `admin.js` |
| `scripts/seed.js` | `seedDemo`, `newestReels`, `npm run seed` |
| `scripts/role.js` | `npm run role -- list`, `-- <phone> admin`, `-- <phone> customer` |
| `seed/mehtamart.json` | Demo data v2 |
| `test/` | `node --test`: 34 tests (handler, store, http, accounts, shop, seed) |
| `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `deploy/compose.yaml`, `deploy/.env.example`, `DEPLOY.md` | Oracle VM deployment |
| `render.yaml` | Old alternative host config (not used) |

Stack: Node 22 (ESM), Express 5, `pg`, `@electric-sql/pglite`, `multer`, `qrcode`, `dotenv`. There's no frontend framework or build step.

## 6. Decisions made

- One shared product catalog. Each reel shows 1–20 products from it.
- Payments are a demo QR for now. A real gateway comes later.
- Light & gold design, from the approved samples artifact.
- The store is public; only checkout needs a login. DM visitors must not hit a login wall.
- Admin rights come only from the server command. There's no UI to grant them. Signups default to customer.
- No SMS or email service, so forgotten passwords are reset by the owner in Admin → Customers.
- Every keyword comment gets a DM; there's no per-user limit (for testing).
- Data lives in the built-in PGlite database on the VM's Docker volume. **PGlite can only be open in one process at a time,** so CLI scripts need the app stopped.

## 7. Environment variables (`.env`; values are never committed)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Long-lived Instagram token (expires after 60 days) |
| `IG_USER_ID` | 17841465186333519 |
| `APP_SECRET` | Instagram app secret, used to verify webhook signatures. If webhooks fail with "bad signature", try the other secret from App settings → Basic. |
| `VERIFY_TOKEN` | Must match Meta's webhook settings (`shoppingforher-verify-2026`) |
| `GRAPH_VERSION` | `v23.0` |
| `DRY_RUN` | `1` = log DMs instead of sending them |
| `ONE_DM_PER_USER` | `1` = one DM per person per reel |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `https://mehtamart.140-238-251-141.sslip.io` (the link used in DMs) |
| `ADMIN_PHONE`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Owner login. The account is made admin on every start. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Empty = built-in database. `DATA_DIR=/data/pgdata` is set in `compose.yaml`. |

## 8. Operations runbook (Oracle VM)

**SSH** from Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
ssh -i "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\oracle-svc-agent.key" ubuntu@140.238.251.141
```
Disconnect the Voltas VPN first. If it times out, the network is blocking port 22: use a phone hotspot or Oracle Cloud Shell.

**Deploy an update:**
```bash
cd ~/mehtamart && git pull && cd deploy && docker compose up -d --build
# wait ~15 s, then:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" 127.0.0.1:8100/health   # 200
```
A `000` right after a restart is normal; wait and check again.

**Logs and restart:**
```bash
cd ~/mehtamart/deploy
docker compose logs web --tail 30
docker compose restart web
```

**Give or remove admin rights.** The person signs up on the site first. This stops the app for a few seconds:
```bash
cd ~/mehtamart/deploy
docker compose stop web && docker compose run --rm web npm run role -- 98XXXXXXXX admin && docker compose start web
# use "customer" to remove the rights, or "list" to see admins
```

**Backup:** see `DEPLOY.md`. It stops `web`, then tars the `mehtamart_data` volume to `~/backups`.

**Rules on this shared VM** (from the user's DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md):
- Only touch the `mehtamart` project.
- Never stop or restart other projects' containers, and never edit other Caddy site files.
- Never publish on `0.0.0.0` or open new ports.
- **Never `docker compose down -v`** (it deletes the data) and never `docker system prune -a`.
- Secrets live only in `.env` on the VM, never in git or chat.
- Other sites on the VM: service bot `https://140-238-251-141.sslip.io` (port 8080) and alerts `https://alerts.140-238-251-141.sslip.io` (port 8000).

**Local development:** `npm install`, `cp .env.example .env`, `npm start` (port 3000), `npm test`.

## 9. Timeline and problems already solved

1. **First DM proof of concept:** Meta app with Instagram login, webhook verified. Fixes:
   - Make the Codespace port Public.
   - Use the right one of the two app secrets.
   - Comment from `_squenza`, not the business account (`skip:own-comment`).
   - Make the DM link clickable with the button template.
2. **Per-reel stores and admin panel,** with Postgres/PGlite. Upgraded to Express 5 for async errors. Fixed a cart.js TDZ bug and `[hidden]` CSS overrides.
3. **Mehta Mart demo data** (3 reels × 12 products), the full-store home page, and the "Open in Chrome" prompt with the bag carried across.
4. **Approved design samples, then the full build:** storefront, Reels tab, accounts, owner tools, Docker deployment files. Docker image built and tested (~260 MB RAM).
5. **Full catalog scrape** (13 categories, 178 products).
6. **Deployed to the VM.** SSH timed out on the office network and worked from another network. Meta webhook switched to the VM. Demo data loaded.
7. **Changes after launch:**
   - Login required to check out.
   - Admin rights only via the role command.
   - Desktop header icons moved to the right.
   - Browsers kept using the old CSS after an update, fixed with asset fingerprints (`?v=`).

## 10. Known gaps and next steps

- **Real payments:** Razorpay or Cashfree checkout, plus a payment webhook that marks orders as paid.
- **Meta App Review** (Advanced Access) so everyone, not just Instagram testers, gets DMs.
- **Token refresh:** the long-lived token expires after 60 days. Add automatic refresh (`GET /refresh_access_token`) or put a reminder in the calendar.
- **Own domain** instead of sslip.io: add a DNS A record to 140.238.251.141, then run `add-site.sh ... --host`.
- **Password reset by SMS/OTP** instead of the owner resetting it.
- **Admin role changes without downtime:** add an admin-only UI, or move to a hosted Postgres so the CLI can run alongside the app.
- **Owner notification for new orders** (WhatsApp or email).
- **Deep links:** `/reels#<slug>` only finds reels in the first batch of 8.
- **Port register:** record 8100 → `mehtamart` in DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md and `infra/oracle-vm/README.md` (still to do).
- **Demo data:** some Mehta Mart prices show very large discounts (e.g. 94% off). That's their data; edit it in Admin if needed.

## Start here (paste into a new chat)

> I'm continuing a project. Repo `Shashank-Codes-bit/Auto_DM`, branch `claude/affectionate-rubin-it8bkq`. Read `HANDOFF.md`, `README.md` and `DEPLOY.md` first. It's an Instagram comment → DM → per-reel shoppable store, demoed as a full store for Mehta Mart, live on my Oracle VM at https://mehtamart.140-238-251-141.sslip.io (Docker, port 8100, Caddy in front, built-in PGlite database in a Docker volume). Develop on the same branch, run `npm test` before pushing, and never put secrets in git or chat. I update the VM with: `cd ~/mehtamart && git pull && cd deploy && docker compose up -d --build`. Next I want to: <your next task>.
